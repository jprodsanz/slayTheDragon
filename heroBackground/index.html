            And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
            <br>
            In the nighttime her face lit up
            <br>
            So astounding I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
            <br>
            She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
            <br>
            She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
            <br>
            Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
            <br>
            I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
